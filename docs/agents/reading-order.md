# Reading Order

Start here when onboarding or investigating cross-repo behavior:

1. `EXPLAINER.md` in this repo for full system mapping and dependencies.
2. `README.md` in this repo for submodule workflow.
3. Each child repo `README.md` for local setup and runtime behavior.
4. Each child repo `docs/SYSTEM_DEPENDENCIES.md` for integration details.
